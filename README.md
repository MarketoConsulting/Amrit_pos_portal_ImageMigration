# Amrit_pos_portal_ImageMigration

Download_from_source_instance: Provide the root folder ID from source instance and assign it to 'root'

Import_into_destination_instabnce: Provide source and destination instance details. We can map the Images and Files (parent folder) in folder_ids also and set Recursive = true, then all the folders under the parent folder will also be mapped with images.
But, if we have mapped sub folders individually, and when we are mapping the parent folder, ensure Recursive = false
